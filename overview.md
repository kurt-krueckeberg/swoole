# Swoole

## Overview

What is Swoole or Open Swoole? Acccording to [Get Started with Open Swoole](https://openswoole.com/docs/get-started-swoole), it is a PHP extension used to create
a certain type of PHP command line (CLI) appliction:

> Open Swoole is released as a PHP PECL (PHP Extension Community Library) extension (written in C++) and runs as a PHP CLI application,
simply by running `$ php server.php`. 

Unlike traditional PHP code, code written to use Open Swoole or Swoole doesn't require a web server like Apache or Nginx; nor does it require php-fpm to be
actively running. According to [How Open Swoole works](https://openswoole.com/how-it-works):

> You can either run OpenSwoole directly on your network or use Apache or Nginx with a proxy pass through setup to accept requests.
OpenSwoole simplifies the PHP server setup as you don't need to run a separate HTTP server, it is all handled at the PHP level,
replacing the need for PHP-FPM.
